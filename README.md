# COVID-19, Socio-Economic Status, and Race

Summary. SARS-CoV2 attaches to particulate matter and regions with higher pollution loads have higher COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Racial minorities and socio-economically disadvantaged groups have higher pollution loads and poorer air quality. In the US and UK, these groups also have higher COVID-19 infection and mortality rate and more severe disease progression. Because pollution and poor air quality also negatively impact olfactory ability, we are interested in whether smell and/or taste loss, in the absence of other symptoms, is a key indicator of COVID-19 infection in these groups, who may already have pre-existing smell and taste disorders from poor air quality. There is a data gap to overcome because smell testing only recently became part of national health initiatives in the US and current pandemic clinical practices do not routinely collect race and ethnicity data. Our study is survey-based and aims to collect information about the experience of smell and taste loss in marginalized groups globally.

Status. The survey was prepared in the online open-source platform formR. We purchased a balanced sample of American Black, Hispanic and white respondents with household incomes below the United States poverty threshold to guarantee sufficient power to detect an effect (using data from GCCR study). The study was submitted to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Institutional Review Board for ethical approval on 15 July. 

Collaborator Profile. 
Our study is small so we are hoping to recruit a few collaborators. We want to boost the careers of individuals who have faced challenges and have a specific contribution to make to this study. If you meet the following criteria, please apply!

Are you
  - A member of a historically marginalized group, with preference for hispanic, black, or indigenous
  - A combination of historically disadvantaged identities

Do you have a low research capacity because 
  - You are in a position with extremely limited capacity for research (e.g., contingent academic positions, teaching-intensive or administration-intensive positions) 
  - You are a caregiver who lost research time during the pandemic and are attempting/hoping to re-enter research

Do you have experience in:
  - Survey-based research, data analysis and/or visualization
  - Ethnography/Community Research
  - Critical race theory and/or health disparities
  - Pollution and/or air quality
  - Working with lower income or minority races for chemosensory research
  - Experience in Qualtrics is a plus!
